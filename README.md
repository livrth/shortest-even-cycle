#### STOC 2022 - The Shortest Even Cycle Problem is Tractable

Given a directed graph as input, this algorithm shows how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices.

The whole process of the algorithm doesn't look very complicated, so I plan to implement it in code to be as efficient as possible. But in a few days after my final exam :)
